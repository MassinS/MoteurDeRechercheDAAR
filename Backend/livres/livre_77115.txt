PREFACE


The manufacture of ice cream is based on certain scientific principles.
It is the purpose of this laboratory manual to help the student to
better understand the application of these principles. This manual,
which is the result of several years’ experience in teaching, is
not intended as a textbook, but as a brief and concise outline of
laboratory exercises. It will also serve as a suitable place for the
student to record observations. The exercises have been prepared, so
that each instructor may make selections and combinations suitable for
the equipment and the needs of his course.

Because this is comparatively a new subject and the ideas regarding ice
cream production and manufacture are constantly changing, the authors
recognize that this manual will need frequent revisions. An effort will
be made to keep it thoroughly up to date.

LABORATORY EQUIPMENT


The exercises in this manual may be selected or easily modified, so
that they will be suitable for any laboratory equipment. For example,
the receipts have been prepared with the expectation that a 10-gallon
freezer would be used; if a smaller freezer is used, the receipts may
be reduced proportionally.

Much better instruction can be given if the equipment includes an
artificial refrigerating plant for freezing and hardening the ice
cream. If the equipment does not include an artificial refrigerating
plant, a tub and can freezer, using an ice and salt mixture for
freezing, and a wooden box for packing and hardening the ice cream, in
ice and salt, may be used. The hardening box should be made of 2 inch
matched lumber so that it will not leak. The size of the box will be
determined by the amount of ice cream manufactured. It should be built
in compartments which will hold six five gallon cans. This will require
a box 26 inches wide by 32 inches deep by 36 inches long, outside
measurement, with a hinged cover for each compartment.

If much ice cream is to be made an ice cream mixer is a necessity, but
if a small amount is made each batch may be mixed in a 40 quart milk
can. A homogenizer and emulsor may be included in the equipment.

With whatever type of freezer is used, there should be one or two
small hand freezers, to freeze small batches and to try new receipts.
An ice crusher should be included for crushing ice.

The equipment should include the necessary small utensils, such as
pails, dippers, ladles, spoons, thermometers, scales, measures, pack
cans, etc.

There should be a suitable sink connected with hot and cold water and
steam, for washing and scalding the utensils. A suitable rack should be
provided for drying and holding the utensils and pack cans. Because of
the salt used, care must be exercised, as it is liable to get on the
utensils and cause them to rust.

All belts and gears on machines should be protected, so that persons
cannot be caught and injured in them.

EXERCISE I REPORT


STANDARDIZATION

One of the main requirements for a successful ice cream business is
uniformity of quality. In order to obtain this, it is necessary to
have cream each time containing the same percentage of fat. As it is
impossible to always get cream of a uniform fat content, the cream
must be standardized. That is, the percentage of fat must be either
increased or decreased to the desired amount. It is the usual practice
to have richer cream than is to be used and reduce it by the addition
of less rich cream, whole milk, or skim milk. If the cream was lower in
percentage of fat than was desired, it could be standardized only by
the addition of richer cream.

Prof. R. A. Pearson has devised a very simple method, known as the
rectangular method of standardization. This method is as follows: draw
a rectangle and place in the center the percentage of fat desired. At
the left hand corners place the percentages of fat in the materials to
be mixed. It is customary to place the larger figure at the top, thus:

[Illustration]

Then subtract diagonally, placing the remainders at the right hand
corners, as shown above. These show the proportions by weight in which
the materials must be mixed to give the desired percentage of fat.

A problem may serve to illustrate the method.

How many pounds each of 30% cream and 4% milk are necessary to make 260
lbs. of 20% cream?

[Illustration]

This shows 16 lbs. 30% cream and 10 lbs. 4% milk make 26 lbs. of
20% cream, but 260 lbs. is required. This is best solved by simple
proportion:

10 lbs. milk∶ 26 lbs. 20% cream∷ x lbs. milk∶ 260 lbs. 20% cream.

Solving x = 100 lbs. 4% milk required and 260-100 lbs. milk = 160 lbs.
30% cream required which may also be determined by proportion.

To be sure no mistakes are made in figuring, it is best to prove all
standardizations. The proof is simple.

    260 lbs. 20% cream contains 52 lbs. fat (required).
    160 lbs. 30%   ”      ”     48 lbs.  ”
    100 lbs.  4% milk     ”      4 lbs.  ”
                                —
              Making a total of 52 lbs. fat, the amount required.

In the above problem a definite amount of the mixture was required.
There is another class of standardization problems in which the amount
of one of the materials is given, to find the quantity of the other
required to standardize it:

How much 4% milk must be mixed with 420 lbs. of 40% cream to make a
mixture testing 25% fat?

[Illustration]

This shows that 15 lbs. of 4% milk will standardize 21 lbs. of 40%
cream to a cream tasting 25% fat. But there are 420 lbs. of 40% cream
to standardize. By simple proportion,

15 lbs. 4% milk∶ 21 lbs. 40% cream∷ x lbs. 4% milk∶ 420 lbs. 40% cream.

Solving x = 300 lbs. 4% milk

420 lbs. cream + 300 lbs. milk = 720 lbs. 25% cream.

Proof:

    720 lbs. of 25% cream contains 180 lbs. fat.
    300 lbs. of  4% milk     ”      12 lbs.  ”
    420 lbs. of 40% cream    ”     168 lbs.  ”
                                   ———
                 Making a total of 180 lbs. fat.




EXERCISE NUMBER II

STANDARDIZATION


Cream and milk to standardize will be furnished.

Test both by the Babcock method and report the result to the
instructor, who will assign a definite percentage of fat for the
standardized mixture.

After standardizing, test a sample of the standardized mixture by the
Babcock method to test the accuracy of your work.

Report all calculations and results on opposite page.

EXERCISE II REPORT




EXERCISE NUMBER III

TESTING ICE CREAM FOR FAT


Ice cream cannot be tested for fat, by the Babcock test, as milk,
because the acid chars the sugar, which interferes with the reading.
Various methods of testing ice cream, so as to overcome this
disadvantage have been devised. A few of the simpler ones follow.

Test a sample of ice cream by each of the following methods and report
results on the opposite page.

Method of Prof. H. E. Ross: Mix equal parts by weight of melted ice
cream and water. Weigh into a 9 gram 50% cream bottle 9 grams of the
mixture. Add 17.5 cc. of glacial acetic acid. Shake for two to three
minutes. Next add 15 cc. of sulphuric acid such as is used for the
Babcock test. Shake for one minute and proceed as in the ordinary
Babcock test. Multiply the reading by two.

Method of J. P. Dawson: Weigh 18 grams of melted ice cream at a
temperature of 70 degrees F. into a 30%, 9 inch cream test bottle. Add
8 cc. of glacial acetic acid, agitate gently for 2 minutes and add 10
cc. of Babcock sulphuric acid. Shake and centrifuge in the usual manner.

Note: There appears to be no reason why one half the quantities of ice
cream and acids may not be used in a 6 inch 9 gram 50% cream bottle.

Method often used by the authors: Weigh 9 grams of melted ice cream
into a 6 inch 50%, 9 gram cream bottle and add about 9 cc. of water.
Add three quarters of an acid measure of glacial acetic acid and mix
thoroughly. Next add two thirds of an acid measure of Babcock sulphuric
acid. Shake till well mixed and centrifuge in the usual manner.

EXERCISE NUMBER IV

EFFECT OF THE SALT AND ICE MIXTURE ON TEMPERATURE


Make a brine one part salt to ten parts of water by weight. With part
of this fill the can of a hand freezer two thirds full just as though
it were an ice cream mix which you were going to freeze. Record the
temperature of this brine.

_Trial_ 1. Using a mixture of one pound of salt to 10 lbs. of crushed
ice, try freezing the brine in the freezer can. Turn 10 minutes,
keeping the freezer can well covered with the ice and salt mixture.
Open and record the temperature of the brine in the can.

_Trial_ 2. Empty the freezer can and tub and refill the can with more
of the brine used in Trial 1. Be sure to have it the same temperature.
Using a salt and ice mixture of the same proportions, pack the tub
again and in addition add enough cold water so that it starts to
run from the overflow hole in the tub. Turn the freezer 10 minutes,
recording the temperature of the brine flowing from the overflow hole
every 2 minutes. Be sure to keep the ice-salt-water mixture in the tub
well mixed by punching with a stick such as a sawed-off broom handle.
Again record the temperature of the brine in the can. Why does it
differ from what it was in Trial 1?

_Trial_ 3. Repeat Trial 2, except use a mixture of salt and ice one to
six instead of one to 10. Record results.

_Trial_ 4. Repeat Trial 3 but do not mix the ice, salt, and water in
the tub. Explain the difference in the results obtained in Trials 3 and
4.

Tabulate and report all the data which you have recorded.

EXERCISE IV REPORT




CLASSIFICATION OF ICE CREAM


In the absence of the adoption of any uniform standard classification
of ice cream, the following classification in use by the authors is
given. It is simple, yet comprehensive, and is arranged according to
fundamental differences in composition. This seems to be the most
logical basis for classifying ice cream and is very satisfactory from
a laboratory standpoint. Exercises and representative formulas will be
given for each of these classes.

I. Plain or uncooked ice cream, often known as Philadelphia ice cream,
is made from cream, sugar, and flavoring, with or without condensed
milk or some stabilizer. It may be subdivided as follows:

    1. Plain—Flavors such as Vanilla, Chocolate, Caramel,
       Coffee, Mint, etc.

    2. Fruit—Flavored with fresh or canned fruits such as
       Peach, Pineapple, Strawberry, Cherry, etc.

    3. Nut—Flavored with such nuts as Walnut, Almond,
       Filbert, Chestnut, Pistachio, etc.

    4. Bisque—Flavored with Marshmallows, Macaroons,
       Sponge Cake, Nabisco Wafers, Grape-nuts, etc.

II. Cooked ice cream, often known as French or Neapolitan ice cream, is
made from cream, sugar, flavoring, and eggs. As custards they sometimes
contain flour or cornstarch. The following subdivisions are recognized:

    1. Parfaits or French—Flavors such as Vanilla,
       Chocolate, etc., are most common, but various
       fruits are sometimes used.

    2. Puddings—These are highly flavored with various
       dried and candied fruits, nuts, and spices.
       Examples are Nesselrode, Roman, and English Plum.

    3. Custards—These contain flour, cornstarch, tapioca,
       or other similar ingredients, and are almost always
       flavored with vanilla.

III. Sherbets and Ices are made from water or milk, sugar, often egg
albumen and a stabilizer, and flavored with fruit juices or other
natural flavoring. The most prominent classes are the following:

    1. Ices—Made from water, sugar and some natural
       flavoring without eggs or a stabilizer. This may
       include granites and frappés. Granites are frozen
       with little agitation, while frappés are only
       semi-frozen to a slushy consistency.

    2. Water Sherbets—are made the same as ices with the
       addition of egg whites and sometimes a stabilizer.
       If the whole egg is used, they are sometimes called
       souffles.

    3. Punches—are ices or water sherbets flavored with
       liquors or highly flavored with fruit juices and
       spices.

    4. Milk Sherbets—Made from skimmed or whole milk,
       sugar, and egg whites, with or without a stabilizer
       and flavored with some natural flavoring.

    5. Lacto—Made from skimmed or whole sour milk instead
       of sweet milk but in other respects they resemble
       milk sherbets.

IV. Mousse is a rich cream, sweetened and whipped to a stiff froth,
flavored and frozen in moulds or cans.

In the laboratories at the New York state agricultural college 20%
cream is used in making all plain or uncooked ice creams. Therefore
in the following exercises and formulas a 20% cream is used as a base
in most cases. This, however, may be reduced to 18% or 16% if it is
thought desirable.

It must be remembered that the formulas given are for laboratory use
and are not especially recommended as ideal formulas for commercial
use. Many of them have given good results in commercial plants but
there are so many variations and combinations possible that no single
formula or group of formulas can be given as ideal for all commercial
plants.

If the use of condensed milk is desired eight pounds of whole condensed
milk may be substituted for the same amount of cream with excellent
results in any of the formulas given for plain ice cream. Most
commercial plants use condensed milk to give the ice cream more body
and better standing quality.




THE USE OF STABILIZERS


A stabilizer of some kind is generally admitted to be necessary in
commercial ice cream. The three most commonly used are gelatin, ice
cream powders and gum tragacanth.

Gelatin may be prepared in any of the three following ways, using
either milk or water for dissolving it. However, if milk is used, one
of the first two methods should be used, so as to avoid any cooked
flavor from boiled milk.

1. Using one pint to one quart of water or milk to each two ounces of
gelatin, soak the gelatin in the cold liquid for fifteen to thirty
minutes. Then heat the mixture up to a temperature of 160 degrees to
170 degrees F. and add to the cream with rapid agitation.

2. The same as number one, except heat the mixture only to a
temperature of 125 degrees to 130 degrees F. for a sufficient time to
thoroughly dissolve all of the gelatin.

3. Heat the necessary amount of water to boiling, dump the gelatin into
it and stir till dissolved. Then add to the cream with rapid stirring.

Ice cream powders should be used according to the directions given with
them.

Gum tragacanth stock is made in the following manner. Place the dry gum
in cold water, using one ounce of gum to four pounds of water. Heat
slowly and uniformly over a low flame or better in a double boiler
to a temperature of about 110 degrees F. Hold at this temperature
for several hours or until the dry gum has absorbed all the water it
will hold. It does not go into true solution in water but will absorb
about fifty times its own weight of the water. Strain through a coarse
strainer and cool. It is then ready for immediate use. Sometimes enough
is made at one time to last for several days, in which case it is best
to add sufficient sugar to keep it from spoiling.

the per cent. of swell in each of the following ways. Record results on
the opposite page.

_Receipt:_

    40 pounds of 20% cream
     8 pounds of sugar
     4 ounces of vanilla extract
     4 ounces of gelatin if desired (See page 21)

1. Measure the gallons of mix used. Then measure in packing cans the
gallons of ice cream obtained and calculate the per cent. of swell.

2. Weigh one gallon of the mix. Weigh the first gallon and the last
gallon of ice cream removed from the freezer and calculate the per
cent. of swell in each case.

3. Take two samples, preferably from different packing cans of ice
cream from the same freezer, and determine the per cent. of swell by
the method given in Bulletin 241 of the Wisconsin Station as follows:
Take a 50 cc. sample of ice cream with the sampler furnished you and
transfer to a 300 cc. beaker, using exactly 200 cc. of hot water to
melt it. Then transfer all of this to a 250 cc. Florence flask and add
1 or 2 cc. of ether (measured) to reduce the foam. Next add enough
water measured from a burette to fill the flask to the mark. The ether
and water required represent the swell. Calculate the per cent. in each
case.

Which method do you consider the most accurate for commercial use and
why? For experimental use and why? Give special advantages of each
test.

HARDENING ICE CREAM

Ice cream may be of the highest quality when removed from the freezer
and yet be ruined before it becomes hard enough to ship unless the
hardening is properly accomplished. The two principal methods in use
are the salt and ice method and the artificially cooled dry hardening
room where the cans of ice cream are simply set in a very cold room
and hardened by still or circulating cold air. The temperature of
such a room should be maintained at near zero F. With either method
the hardening process should not require more than twelve hours. The
packing cans should always be cold before they are filled with ice
cream, so as to prevent melting in the bottom.

_Directions for hardening in salt and ice._ Either ordinary packing
tubs or a large box may be used for this purpose. If tubs are used,
simply pack well with salt and ice mixed in the proportion of one to
eight. It is necessary to repack these tubs two or three times a day in
order to keep the ice cream hard. When several cans of ice cream are
to be hardened at a time a better method, more economical in labor and
material, is to pack the empty cans up to the covers in a large box,
using salt and ice, one to eight. The soft ice cream is poured into
these partly packed cans and when full they are completely covered with
the ice and salt mixture. With such a box it is not necessary to repack
oftener than twice a day.

       3  ounces of vanilla extract
       1¼ pounds chocolate with 4 pounds of water and one pound of sugar
             (cocoa may be used if desired).

Fill the outside of a few center mold bricks with vanilla ice cream.
Harden in a salt and ice mixture one part salt to two parts of ice.
When hard withdraw the center mold and fill with the strawberry or
chocolate ice cream. Again pack in salt and ice to harden.

Fill a few fancy individual molds and pack in the salt and ice mixture
till hard.

Each student should make a 3 layer tri-colored brick. First prepare the
molds, attach your name and pack in salt and ice to become thoroughly
cold. As the vanilla ice cream is drawn from the freezer fill each mold
one third full and pack in the salt and ice mixture, so that it will be
hardened by the time the strawberry ice cream is ready to be drawn off.
Then fill another one third with the strawberry. Finish filling with
the chocolate, being sure to have the brick so full of soft cream that
no brine can enter under the lid. Care should be taken each time to
have the bricks set level in the salt and ice.

SCORE CARD FOR ICE CREAM


The comparison of ice creams is accomplished best by reducing their
quality to a numerical basis. This is done by use of a score card. Two
score cards are suggested as follows:

                              _Modification of the_
    _Cornell Score Card        Wisconsin Score Card_

    Flavor             45    Flavor             40
    Body and texture   35    Body and texture   25
    Richness           10    Bacterial count    15
    Appearance          5    Richness           10
    Package             5    Appearance          5
                      ———     Package            5
                                               ———
                      100                      100

It may be more advantageous to use the Cornell score card in the
Laboratory because immediate results can be obtained, while with the
modified Wisconsin score card bacterial counts must be made of the ice
cream, so that it would be two to three days before the final score of
the ice cream could be obtained.


DISCUSSION OF QUALITIES OF ICE CREAM

_Flavor._ The ice cream should have a pronounced flavor which will
blend with the flavor of the cream to give a clean, desirable typical
flavor.

_Body and Texture._ The body should be firm and mellow. It should not
be tough or rubbery neither soft or mushy. The texture should be smooth
and velvety and entirely free from graininess and lumpiness.

_Richness._ If the ice cream meets the legal requirements, it should
be given a perfect score. If it falls below the legal requirement, it
should be scored zero.

_Appearance._ The ice cream should have an attractive appearance and be
of the characteristic uniform color.

_Package._ The package should be neat and clean and, if for long
shipment, some provision should be made to protect the ice on top of
the packing tub.

_Bacterial count._ An ice cream which has a count of 20,000 should be
considered perfect. For each increase of 20,000 above this one point
should be deducted from the score.

_Application of score card._ When judging samples of ice cream, it is
best to try some of them to obtain some idea of the qualities of the
samples to be scored. This is necessary so that the score will not run
above 100 and to set a standard. Then with a definite standard in mind,
the samples may be carefully scored. The cuts in score should be made
in proportion to the quality of the ice cream and the definite standard
in mind.




EXERCISE NUMBER XX

JUDGING PLAIN ICE CREAM


Score and criticize the samples of plain ice cream recording the scores
on the opposite page. (For score card see page 64.)

One sample will first be scored by the instructor as an example and
guide to the severeness of the cut for different defects. After the
students have finished, he will score the remaining samples with them.

Three of the samples are ice cream made in the college laboratory. The
others are purchased and represent well known commercial ice creams.

After scoring on all other points make a fat test of each sample. (See
page 14.)

Updated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away—you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg”), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg™ License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg™
electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg™
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg™ electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work
on which the phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the
phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at www.gutenberg.org. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg™
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg™.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg™ License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original “Plain
Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg™ works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
provided that:

    • You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.”
    
    • You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    
    • You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    
    • You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.
    

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project

Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
