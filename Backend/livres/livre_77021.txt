FOREWORD


On the assumption that my technique is either complicated or original
or both, the publishers have politely requested me to write an
introduction to this book.

At least my theory of technique, if I have one, is very far from
original; nor is it complicated. I can express it in fifteen words,
by quoting The Eternal Question And Immortal Answer of burlesk, viz.
“Would you hit a woman with a child?--No, I’d hit her with a brick.”
Like the burlesk comedian, I am abnormally fond of that precision which
creates movement.

If a poet is anybody, he is somebody to whom things made matter very
little--somebody who is obsessed by Making. Like all obsessions, the
Making obsession has disadvantages; for instance, my only interest in
making money would be to make it. Fortunately, however, I should prefer
to make almost anything else, including locomotives and roses. It is
with roses and locomotives (not to mention acrobats Spring electricity
Coney Island the 4th of July the eyes of mice and Niagara Falls) that
my “poems” are competing.

They are also competing with each other, with elephants, and with El
Greco.

Ineluctable preoccupation with The Verb gives a poet one priceless
advantage: whereas nonmakers must content themselves with the merely
undeniable fact that two times two is four, he rejoices in a purely
irresistible truth (to be found, in abbreviated costume, upon the title
page of the present volume.)

    with breathing as (faithfully) her lownecked
    dress a little topples and slightly expands

    one square foot mired in silk wrinkling loth
    stocking begins queerly to do a few
    gestures to death,
                      the silent shoulders are both
    slowly with pinkish ponderous arms bedecked
    whose white thick wrists deliver promptly to
    a deep lap enormous mindless hands.
    and no one knows what (i am sure of this)
    her blunt unslender, what her big unkeen

    “Business is rotten” the face yawning said

    what her mouth thinks of
                            (if it were a kiss
    distinct entirely melting sinuous lean . . .
    whereof this lady in some book had read


II. MAME

    she puts down the handmirror. “Look at” arranging
    before me a mellifluous idiot grin
    (with what was nose upwrinkled into nothing
    earthly, while the slippery eyes drown
    in surging flesh). A thumblike index down-
    dragging yanks back skin “see” (i, seeing, ceased
    to breathe). The plump left fist opening
    “wisdom.” Flicker of gold. “Yep. No gas. Flynn”

    the words drizzle untidily from released
    cheeks “I’ll tell duh woild; some noive all right.
    Aint much on looks but how dat baby ached.”

    and when i timidly hinted “novocaine?”
    the eyes outstart, curl, bloat, are newly baked

    and swaggering cookies of indignant light


III. GERT

    joggle i think will do it although the glad
    monosyllable jounce possibly can tell
    better how the balloons move (as
    her ghost lurks, a Beau Brummel sticking in its three-

    cornered always moist mouth)--jazz,
    for whose twitching lips, between you and me
    almost succeeds while toddle rings the bell.
    But if her tall corpsecoloured body seat
    itself (with the uncouth habitual dull
    jerk at garters) there’s no sharpest neat
    word for the thing.
                        Her voice?
                                  gruesome:a trull
    leaps from the lungs “gimme uh swell fite

    like up ter yknow, Rektuz, Toysday nite;
    where uh guy gets gayn troze uh lobstersalad


IV. MARJ

    “life?
          Listen” the feline she with radishred
    legs said (crossing them slowly)“I’m
    asleep. Yep. Youse is asleep kid
    and everybody is.” And i hazarded
    “god” (blushing slightly)--“O damn
    ginks like dis Gawd” opening slowlyslowly
    them--then carefully the rolypoly
    voice squatting on a mountain of gum did
    something like a whisper, “even her.”
    “The Madam?” I emitted; vaguely watching
    that mountainous worthy in the fragile act
    of doing her eyebrows.--Marj’s laughter smacked
    me: pummeling the curtains, drooped to a purr . . .

    i left her permanently smiling


V. FRAN

    should i entirely ask of god why
    on the alert neck of this brittle whore
    delicately wobbles an improbably distinct face,
    and how these wooden big two feet conclude
    happeningly the unfirm drooping bloated
    calves
          i would receive the answer more
    or less deserved, Young fellow go in peace.
    which i do, being as Dick Mid once noted
    lifting a Green River (here’s to youse)
    “a bloke wot’s well behaved” . . . and always try
    to not wonder how let’s say elation
    causes the bent eyes thickly to protrude--

    or why her tiniest whispered invitation
    is like a clock striking in a dark house

    skunks in a subtle manner

    but somebody who’d given my Uncle Sol a Victor
    Victrola and records while he lived presented to

Will i ever forget that precarious moment?

As i was standing on the third rail waiting for the next train to grind
me into lifeless atoms various ab- surd thoughts slyly crept into my
highly sexed mind.

It seemed to me that i had first of all really made quite a mistake
in being at all born, seeing that i was wifeless and only half awake,
cursed with pimples, correctly dressed, cleanshaven above the nombril,
and much to my astonishment much impressed by having once noticed (
as an infantile phenomenon ) George Washington almost incompletely
surrounded by well- drawn icecakes beheld being too strong, in brief
:an American, if you understand that i mean what i say i believe my
most intimate friends would never have gathered.

A collarbutton which had always not nothurt me not much and in the same
place.

Why according to tomorrow’s paper the proletariat will not rise
yesterday.

Inexpressible itchings to be photographed with Lord Rothermere playing
with Lord Rothermere billiards very well by moonlight with Lord
Rothermere.

A crockodile eats a native, who in revenge beats it insensible
with a banana, establishing meanwhile a re- ligious cult based on
consubstantial intangibility.

Personne ne m’aime et j’ai les mains froides.

His Royal Highness said “peek-a-boo” and thirty tame fleas left the
prettily embroidered howdah im- mediately.

Thumbprints of an angel named Frederick found on a lightning-rod,
Boston, Mass.

such were the not unhurried reflections to which my organ of
imperception gave birth to which i should or- dinarily have objected to
which, considering the back- ground, it is hardly surprising if anyone
hardly should call exactly extraordinary. We refer, of course, to my
position. A bachelor incapable of occupation, he had long suppressed
the desire to suppress the suppressed desire of shall we say: Idleness,
while meaning its opposite? Nothing could be clearer to all concerned
than that i am not a policeman.

Meanwhile the tea regressed.

Kipling again H. G. Wells, and Anatole France shook hands again and yet
again shook again hands again, the former coachman with a pipewrench
of the again latter then opening a box of newly without exaggeration
shot with some difficulty sardines. Mr. Wiggin took Wrs. Miggin’s harm
in is, extinguishing the spitoon by a candle furnished by courtesy of
the management on Thursdays, opposite which a church stood perfectly
upright but not piano item:a water- melon causes indigestion to William
Cullen Longfel- low’s small negro son, Henry Wordsworth Bryant.

By this time,however,the flight of crows had ceased. I withdrew my
hands from the tennisracket. All was over. One brief convulsive
octopus, and then our hero folded his umbrella.

It seemed too beautiful.

Let us perhaps excuse me if i repeat himself:these,or nearly these,were
the not unpainful thoughts which occupied the subject of our
attention;to speak even less objectively,i was horribly scared i would
actually fall off the rail before the really train after all arrived.
If i should have made this perfectly clear,it entirely would have been
not my fault.

    supposing i dreamed this)
    only imagine, when day has thrilled
    you are a house around which
    i am a wind--

    your walls will not reckon how
    strangely my life is curved
    since the best he can do
    is to peer through windows, unobserved

    --listen, for(out of all
    things)dream is noone’s fool;
    if this wind who i am prowls
    carefully around this house of you

    love being such, or such,
    the normal corners of your heart
    will never guess how much
    my wonderful jealousy is dark

    if light should flower:
    or laughing sparkle from
    the shut house(around and around
    which a poor wind will roam




X


    you are like the snow only
    purer fleeter, like the rain
    only sweeter frailer you

    whom certain
    flowers ressemble but trembling(cowards
    which fear
    to miss within your least gesture the hurting
    skill which lives)and since

    nothing lingers
    beyond a little instant,
    along with rhyme and with laughter
    O my lady
    (and every brittle marvelous breathing thing)

    since i and you are on our ways to dust

    of your fragility
    (but chiefly of your smile,
    most suddenly which is
    of love and death a marriage)you give me

    courage
    so that against myself
    the sharp days slobber in vain:

    Nor am i afraid that
    this, which we call autumn, cleverly
    dies and over the ripe world wanders with
    a near and careful
    smile in his mouth(making

    everything suddenly old and with his awkward eyes
    pushing
    sleep under and thoroughly
    into all beautiful things)

    winter, whom Spring shall kill




XI


    because
    you go away i give roses who
    will advise even yourself, lady
    in the most certainly(of what we
    everywhere do not touch)deep
    things;
          remembering ever so
    tinily these, your crisp
    eyes actually shall contain new faeries

    (and if your slim lips are amused, no wisest

    painter of fragile
    Marys will understand
    how smiling may be made as
    skilfully.) But carry
    also, with that indolent and with
    this flower wholly whom you do
    not ever fear,
                me in your heart

    softly;not all
    but the beginning

    of mySelf




XII


    you being in love
    will tell who softly asks in love,

    am i separated from your body smile brain hands merely
    to become the jumping puppets of a dream? oh i mean:
    entirely having in my careful how
    careful arms created this at length
    inexcusable, this inexplicable pleasure--you go from several
    persons:believe me that strangers arrive
    when i have kissed you into a memory
    slowly, oh seriously
    --that since and if you disappear

    solemnly
    myselves
    ask “life, the question how do i drink dream smile

    and how do i prefer this face to another and
    why do i weep eat sleep--what does the whole intend”
    they wonder. ohandthey cry “to be,being,thatiamalive
    this absurd fraction in its lowest terms
    with everything cancelled
    but shadows
    --what does it all come down to? love? Love
    if you like and i like, for the reason that i
    hate people and lean out of this window is love,love
    and the reason that i laugh and breathe is oh love and the reason

    that i do not fall into this street is love.”




XIII


    Nobody wears a yellow
    flower in his buttonhole
    he is altogether a queer fellow
    as young as he is old

    when autumn comes,
    who twiddles his white thumbs
    and frisks down the boulevards

    without his coat and hat

    --(and i wonder just why that
    should please him or i wonder what he does)

    and why(at the bottom of this trunk,
    under some dirty collars)only a
    moment
    (or
    was it perhaps a year)ago i found staring

    me in the face a dead yellow small rose




XIV


    it is so long since my heart has been with yours

    shut by our mingling arms through
    a darkness where new lights begin and
    increase,
    since your mind has walked into
    my kiss as a stranger
    into the streets and colours of a town--

    that i have perhaps forgotten
    how, always(from
    these hurrying crudities
    of blood and flesh)Love
    coins His most gradual gesture,

    and whittles life to eternity

    --after which our separating selves become museums
    filled with skilfully stuffed memories

    i am a beggar always
    who begs in your mind

    (slightly smiling, patient, unspeaking
    with a sign on his
    breast
    BLIND)yes i

    am this person of whom somehow
    you are never wholly rid(and who

    does not ask for more than
    just enough dreams to
    live on)
            after all, kid

    you might as well
    toss him a few thoughts

    a little love preferably,
    anything which you can’t
    pass off on other people: for
    instance a
    plugged promise--

    then he will maybe(hearing something
    fall into his hat)go wandering
    after it with fingers;till having

    found
    what was thrown away
                        himself
    taptaptaps out of your brain, hopes, life

    to(carefully turning a
    corner)never bother you any more.

    how myself has been coarse and dull

    to my mind always

    But now she sharpens and becomes crisper
    until i smile with knowing

    gesture lightly my eyes?
    And send life out of me and the night
    absolutely into me. . . . a wise
    and puerile moving of your arm will
    do suddenly that

                    will do
    more than heroes beautifully in shrill
    armour colliding on huge blue horses,
    and the poets looked at them, and made verses,

    through the sharp light cryingly as the knights flew.

    touching you i say (it being Spring
    and night) “let us go a very little beyond
    the last road--there’s something to be found”

    and smiling you answer “everything
    turns into something else, and slips away. . . .
    (these leaves are Thingish with moondrool
    and i’m ever so very little afraid”)
                                        i say
    “along this particular road the moon if you’ll
    notice follows us like a big yellow dog. You

    don’t believe? look back. (Along the sand
    behind us, a big yellow dog that’s . . . . now it’s red
    a big red dog that may be owned by who
    knows)

    there’s the moon,there is something faithful and mad”




III


    along the brittle treacherous bright streets
    of memory comes my heart,singing like
    an idiot, whispering like a drunken man

    who(at a certain corner, suddenly)meets
    the tall policeman of my mind.
                                    awake
    being not asleep, elsewhere our dreams began
    which now are folded:but the year completes
    his life as a forgotten prisoner

    --“Ici?”--“Ah non, mon cheri; il fait trop froid”--
    they are gone:along these gardens moves a wind bringing
    rain and leaves, filling the air with fear
    and sweetness. . . .pauses. (Halfwhispering. . . .halfsinging

    our touching hearts slenderly comprehend
    (clinging as fingers, loving one another
    gradually into hands) and bend
    into the huge disaster of the year:

    like this most early single star which tugs

    weakly at twilight, caught in thickening fear
    our slightly fingering spirits starve and smother;
    until autumn abruptly wholly hugs

    our dying silent minds, which hand in hand
    at some window try to understand
    the
       (through pale miles of perishing air, haunted
    with huddling infinite wishless melancholy,
    suddenly looming) accurate undaunted

    the glance too shy--if through my singing slips

    the keen primeval silence of your hair

    nothing from death”--
                         you only will create

contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
